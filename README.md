# pwupload

A lightweight tool that makes it easy to upload Written Reports for Hwa Chong's Annual Projects Day by hiding the complicated FTP process from the end user.

The upload process is simplified such that users only need to enter their group name and the relevant password; they are then presented with a simple form for them to upload their project report, and a quick link to check if the upload was successful.

This tool was made due to how the "official" upload process requires users to understand how to use FTP, and many of them didn't and often got frustrated, hence the creation of this tool that automates the FTP uploading behind the scenes.
